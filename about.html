    <h1>Who is Nidera?</h1>

    <p>Hi there! My name is Nidera. I am someone who is fascinated by all sorts of things!</p>

    <p>One of my main hobbies in playing Japanese Arcade Rhythm games. Some of the notable ones I can play well:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><strong>DanceDanceRevolution:</strong> Have cleared up to Level 18 on the Modern DDR Scale.</li>
      <li><strong>beatmania IIDX:</strong> Have cleared some 12s on AC and CS and am 8th Dan on INFINITAS as of 01/12/2021</li>
      <li><strong>pop'n Music:</strong> Have cleared up to Level 46 on the modern Pop'n Scale.</li>
      <li><strong>Sound Voltex:</strong> Have cleared several 17s and I am still progressing through the song list on USC and at the Arcade.</li>
      <li><strong>Pump it Up:</strong> Highest clear is S19 on singles and D18 on doubles. I do have a few Grade A runs on some S20s in PIU.</li>
      <li><strong>BMS (beatmania IIDX simulator):</strong> I'm still breaking into the Insane difficulty of songs in BMS but can play most sl0 (on the Satellite Table) songs.</li>  
    </ul>

    <p>I also actively play Trading Card Games a fair bit and can play Cardfight Vanguard very well and the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game somewhat well too. <br> 
    
    Not only that, I like learning a lot of things in my spare time, such as making this about page and learning about how to make a website and utilize HTML5 and CSS and Javascript. <br>
    
    That is all for now.</p>
